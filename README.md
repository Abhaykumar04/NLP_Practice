### The typical sequence for NLP work is as follows:

→ Tokenization: This is the process of breaking down a text into individual words or meaningful units called tokens. This can be done using simple rules, such as splitting on whitespace, or more sophisticated techniques, such as using a natural language toolkit (NLTK) tokenizer.

→ Stemming or Lemmatization: Once a text has been tokenized, the next step is to reduce each token to its base form. This can be done using stemming or lemmatization. Stemming is a more aggressive process that simply cuts off the endings of words, while lemmatization uses a dictionary or morphological analysis to identify the correct base form of the word.

→ Regular Expressions (RegEx): RegEx is a powerful tool for pattern matching and can be used to find specific words or phrases in a text. It is often used in conjunction with tokenization and stemming or lemmatization to clean and prepare text for further analysis.

→ Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: POS tagging is the process of assigning a grammatical category to each word in a text. This information can be used to improve the accuracy of machine learning algorithms for tasks such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition.

→ Stop Word Removal: Stop words are common words that are not considered to be very informative, such as "the," "a," and "an." Removing stop words can help to reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.

This is a general guideline, and the specific order of these steps may vary depending on the particular NLP task being performed. For example, POS tagging may be performed before stemming or lemmatization in order to preserve grammatical information.

## Conclusion
NLP is one of the fast-growing research domains in AI, with applications that involve tasks including translation, summarization, text generation, and sentiment analysis. Businesses use NLP to power a growing number of applications, both internal — like detecting insurance fraud, determining customer sentiment, and optimizing aircraft maintenance — and customer-facing, like Google Translate. 

Aspiring NLP practitioners can begin by familiarizing themselves with foundational AI skills: performing basic mathematics, coding in Python, and using algorithms like decision trees, Naive Bayes, and logistic regression. Online courses can help you build your foundation. They can also help as you proceed into specialized topics. Specializing in NLP requires a working knowledge of things like neural networks, frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, and various data preprocessing techniques. The transformer architecture, which has revolutionized the field since it was introduced in 2017, is an especially important architecture.

NLP is an exciting and rewarding discipline, and has potential to profoundly impact the world in many positive ways. Unfortunately, NLP is also the focus of several controversies, and understanding them is also part of being a responsible practitioner. For instance, researchers have found that models will parrot biased language found in their training data, whether they’re counterfactual, racist, or hateful. Moreover, sophisticated language models can be used to generate disinformation. A broader concern is that training large models produces substantial greenhouse gas emissions.
